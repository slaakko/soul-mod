    <h1>5 Parser Optimizations</h1>

    <h2>5.1 Switch Optimization</h2>
    <p>
        The switch optimization is enabled by running the <em>spg</em> command with the --<em>optimize</em> option.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a switch-optimized parser a group of <a href="../syntax/parser.html#choice">choice</a> parsing expressions is implemented as a switch statement
        whose condition is current input token and cases are token ids included in the FIRST sets of the 
        choice parsers. The precondition of applying this optimization is that the FIRST sets are distinct.
